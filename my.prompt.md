Implement a **contact form** using **shadcn/ui** with the latest best practices.

- Read and understand the project’s **package.json** to align with its dependencies and Next.js version.
- Use the official docs as reference: [shadcn/ui form](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form).
- Since knowledge may be outdated, also **search Google for the most recent patterns** (validation, form handling, schema, TypeScript support, accessibility).
- Deliver a clean, production-ready implementation with:

  - **Validation** (Zod + React Hook Form preferred if supported).
  - **Error handling & success states**.
  - **Accessible form fields** (name, email, message).
  - **Submit button with loading state**.
  - **Tailwind-styled layout** consistent with shadcn/ui.

Focus on minimal, modern, and reliable code.
